# Talent Academy Website

As a student studying cybersecurity and passionate about technology, Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project: a full-stack website that I built entirely on my own!

This website was inspired by my coursework at CPCC and my desire to create something real and functional while learning.
From my first class, Web, Programming & Database Foundations, I began developing my skillsâ€”and taught myself a lot outside of class to bring this project to life.


## Project Overview

On the **frontend**, I focused on crafting a visually engaging and responsive user interface.
Using **HTML** and **CSS**, I implemented adaptable layouts and smooth animations to provide a modern experience across all devices.

On the **backend**, I created a feedback/contact form that sends user messages directly to a **Google Sheets** spreadsheet using **JavaScript**.
This feature is a simple, practical, and free way to stay connected with customers.

Throughout this journey, I embraced modern tools and used **AI-powered coding assistants** to boost productivity and ensure code quality.
It helped me learn faster and follow best practices in web development!


## Main Features

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop  
- Contact form connected to Google Sheets

## Final Thought

This mindset shaped every decision I made in this projectâ€”from design to functionality.
With over 10 years of experience in customer service, I truly understand how important it is for a website to be clear, comfortable to use, and customer-focused.
I kept this in mind while designing every part of this websiteâ€”from the layout to the contact formâ€”ensuring it remained simple, accessible, and user-friendly.

But this project is more than just a website.
Itâ€™s a demonstration of my ability to learn independently, solve real-world problems, and combine different technologies into a complete, polished product.
I integrated custom button styles, responsive typography, animations, and Google Sheets functionality - all while staying focused on the end user.

This experience helped me grow not only as a developer, but as a creative thinker, a disciplined learner, and someone who takes full ownership of their work - from idea to final result.

As I continue growing in the tech field, I look forward to contributing my skills, creativity, and strong work ethic to meaningful projects especially in collaborative, forward-thinking environments where quality, curiosity, and user experience truly matter.
